    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium">Functionalizing Modularizing Software</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-secondary">
      In Orchestrator, existing codebases can be transformed into reusable graphical nodes with just a few lines of code. Powering this functionality is the Oloren CodeCraft engine, with bindings for React and Python out of the box for rapid adoption. These generated nodes are packaged into modular extensions which can be shared, exported, and reused across your team.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium">Instant Integration</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-secondary">
      By leveraging code containerization and the serverless cloud, Orchestrator enables instant integration of custom-built and off-the-shelf software. Each solution is encapsulated within a container as an extension, creating a cohesive extension ecosystem. An organization can load a single extension or an entire package of extensions from the Oloren Store to unlock instant functionality. This means accessing chemoinformatic capabilities with a single click via the Oloren Chemoinformatics Package or taking data scraping and wrangling to another level with the Oloren Data Science Package.

    <p class="text-lg text-secondary">
      Orchestrator’s Graph Editor allows users to connect and integrate software via an intuitive graphical interface which makes building complex workflows and understanding data interchanges simple. Orchestrator meets teams where they’re at, with integrations across cloud infrastructure, productivity suites, databases, and more. These connections streamline communication within an organization and let teams keep using the tools and platforms they know and love.

    <p class="text-lg text-secondary">
      Orchestrator connects teams. With Oloren’s AppNexus, Orchestrator workflows are accessible and shareable with no extra effort. Workflows built with Orchestrator can be exported as shareable graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or application program interfaces (APIs), enabling Orchestrator workflows to integrate into more complex workflows and applications.
